\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}Data class that is typically used as input for the methods that are part of the Bayesian network inference
module. Each vehicle got its own data instance. If there is no Bayesian network ID set there will be no inference
for the respective vehicle.
(Python dataclasses.dataclass object.)

Attributes
----------
vehicle_id : str
    Identifier of the respective vehicle.
vehicle_situation_state_id : BayesianNetId
    State of the vehicle relative to the ego vehicle and its situation class.
    (E.g. indicating the state of being a front vehicle in a lane following situation.)
vehicle_location : Location
    Position of the vehicle in the world coordinate system. Required for the filtering of vehicles, e.g., the
    filtering of the nearest front vehicle to the ego in case of several front vehicles.
bayesian_network_id : Optional[str]
    Identifier for the Bayesian network that shall be used for the inference. Will only be set if the inference
    will be performed for this specific vehicle. (The default value is None.)
sinadra_risk_sensor_data : Optional[SINADRARiskSensorData]
    Input data class comprising the situation input features that will be fed to the Bayesian network configuration
    for situation-specific runtime updates of the evidences. Will only be set if the inference will be performed
    for this specific vehicle. (The default value is None.)
bayesian_network_config : Optional[BayesianNetworkConfig]
    Configuration object of this specific Bayesian network that allows situation-specific runtime updates of the
    evidences of the Bayesian network. Will only be set if the inference will be performed for this specific
    vehicle. (The default value is None.)
bayesian_network_model : Optional[BayesianModel]
    Bayesian network for this specific vehicle as pgmpy Bayesian model object. Will only be set if the inference
    will be performed for this specific vehicle. (The default value is None.)
